-------------
CREATE TABLE sample(key string,value string) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED AS TEXTFILE;

LOAD DATA FROM LOCAL
--------------------
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH '/home/cloudera/hadoop-workshop/hive/sample-data.txt' INTO TABLE sample;

LOAD DATA FROM HDFS
--------------------
LOAD DATA INPATH '/home/cloudera/hadoop-workshop/hive/sample-data.txt' INTO TABLE sample;
Note: If load hdfs file then it move to hive table.

QUERY DATA
-----------
SELECT * FROM sample; [It doesn't launch any Job]
SELECT MAX(key) FROM sample; [It launches both Mapper Reducer]
SELECT key from sample; [It launches map only Job]

STORE QUERY RESULT DATA
-----------------------
1. Insert the results into local directory
INSERT OVERWRITE LOCAL DIRECTORY '/home/cloudera/hadoop-workshop/hive/sample2' SELECT * from sample LIMIT 4;
2. Insert the results into hdfs directory
INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/user/hive/sample2' SELECT * from sample LIMIT 4;

SHOW TABLES
-----------
hive (workshop)> SHOW TABLES;
If we arenâ€™t in the same database, we can still list the tables in that database:
hive>SHOW TABLES IN workshop;

TABLE DETAILS
--------------
DESCRIBE EXTENDED sample;
DESCRIBE EXTENDED workshop.sample;

Replacing EXTENDED with FORMATTED provides more readable
DESCRIBE FORMATTED sample;


EXTERNAL TABLES
===============
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE sample_external(key int, value string)ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' STORED AS TEXTFILE LOCATION '/user/hive/sample-inputs';

[Note: The above location should be directory that having the hive table.]

SELECT * FROM sample_external;
